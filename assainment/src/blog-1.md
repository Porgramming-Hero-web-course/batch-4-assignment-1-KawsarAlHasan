Union and Intersection types in TypeScript increase flexibility and type safety. Union types allow variables to hold multiple possible types, allowing code to adapt to different inputs, while intersection types combine multiple types, creating complex objects with all the required properties. Together, they enable stronger type-checking and cleaner, more versatile code structures.
